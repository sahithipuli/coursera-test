            creative writing juices flowing, using a random paragraph can
            be a great way to do this. One of the great benefits of this 
            tool is that nobody knows what is going to appear in the 
            paragraph. This can be leveraged in a few different ways to 
            force the writer to use creativity. For example, the random 
            paragraph can be used as the beginning paragraph of a story 
            that the writer must finish.</p> </div>
